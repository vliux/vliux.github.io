I was born in Hangzhou, a warm, cosy and beatiful city of east China. The city is famous of the natural and historic scenearies. After graduated from college I spent 2 years in Stockholm for further education, and then moved to Beijing for my first job there as a software engineer. At the end of the 3rd happy year in Beijing I met a girl in a business trip to Hangzhou. Then after 1 year I made the decision and moved back to my home town --- to live together with her all my life.

I have thoroughly devoted to Android application development for more than 2 years. I believe something like Android is the future of smart electronics. Every device around us will be backed by such intelligence, while they are connected to each other or to the cloud, to make our lives better.

In spare time after work, I make applications for myself, or for some of my friends running their business. [GestureCut](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vliux.android.gesturecut) is the first Android application I developed and released alone, which will not be the last. 

I'm eager to learn, eager to grow with anybody who has expertises especially in Android platform.
