I have worked in Software Engineer for 8 years, in which 2 of most recent years I have thoroughly devoted to Android application development. I believe something like Android is the future of smart electronics. Every device around us will be backed by such intelligence, while they are connected to each other or to the cloud, to make our lives better.

In spare time after work, I make applications for myself, or for some of my friends running their business. [GestureCut](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vliux.android.gesturecut) is the first Android application I developed and released alone, which will not be the last. 

I'm eager to learn, eager to grow with anybody who has expertises especially in Android platform.
